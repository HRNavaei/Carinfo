# Carinfo Web Application

A website for showcasing cars, including details about sellers, such as their prices and contact information. It is similar to the Iranian website torob.com but is specifically focused on cars.

Currently, the API has been built and is ready for use. The frontend part of the application is under development, with completed portions located in the "public" directory.
